- 👋 Hi, I’m @dawerty98
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, music composition, audio production, graphics design (mainly vector based).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and GitHub
(mostly i was using C, C++ and local files and copy/backup management (for one person sufficient))
(and i think that i might be trying something to big for one person...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing particular; i can help, but mostly works alone
- 📫 How to reach me is well... wherever i can be found with nick (dawerty98) (Discord, etc and of course games)
